Note : For basic understanding of code and project please go through the ppt in Basic Project "understanding PPT".


How to run the code: 

        1.There exist 3 python codes in "Working Code Templets" folder named "Company_Article_Generation.ipynb" , "People_Article_Generation" and "Place_Article_Generation"
        2.Run any of the codes based on your requirement
        3.Input 1 letter or 2 letter input (basically your search)
        4.And the output would be made in the end of your code in form of a variable named "output"

//Working Code Templets (Folder name)
    {If you want to check the code upload the code on google colab or jupiter notebook 
    and the code is fully functional in present state}
        
//Necessary Functions (Folder name)
    All the functions used in the working code directly and made for a specific task.

//Sencence Templets (Folder name)
    All the sentene structures used to make the article are saved here with names "Company_Templet.py" , "Place_Templet.py" and "Person_templet.py"

Note: All the main codes will print a query so if required queries would always be available in code.
