To modify and make the code of the same format you need to change 2 portions of the code : 

1: The query 
You will find a variable named query4
you would have to manually change the statements in the code.
e.g.: 
1: delete all other optional queries 
2: add queries to the form :

OPTIONAL
      { ?item  wdt:P1448  ?Company_Official_name }

//where "?item" remains the same,"wdt:P1448" is the variable you can find on wiki data "every variable has a different id"
and "?Comany_Official_name" is the name you give to variables//

3: You will find a statement before "Where" in query 1
Statement:{"SELECT DISTINCT  ?item ?itemLabel ?itemDescription (SAMPLE(?Name) AS ?NameSample) (SAMPLE(?F_language) AS ?F_languageSample)}

Change all (SAMPLE(?Name) AS ?NameSample) statements 
where new statement is (SAMPLE(?'saved variable' AS ?'Renamed variable'))


//END//


With all these modifications, the code would be fully functional.
